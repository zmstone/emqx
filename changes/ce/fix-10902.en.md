Avoid syncing cluser.hocon file from the nodes runing a newer version than self.

During cluster rolling upgrade, if an older version node has to restart due to whatever reason,
if it copies the cluster.hocon file from a newer version node, it may fail to start.
After this fix, the older version node will not copy the cluster.hocon file from a newer,
so it will use its own cluster.hocon file to start.
