EMQX is the most scalable and popular open-source MQTT broker with a high performance that connects 100M+ IoT devices in 1 cluster at 1ms latency. Move and process millions of MQTT messages per second.

The EMQX v5.0 has been verified in [test scenarios](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/reaching-100m-mqtt-connections-with-emqx-5-0) to scale to 100 million concurrent device connections, which is a critically important milestone for IoT designers. It also comes with plenty of exciting new features and huge performance improvements, including a more powerful [rule engine](https://www.emqx.com/en/solutions/iot-rule-engine), enhanced security management, Mria database extension, and much more to enhance the scalability of IoT applications.

During the last several years, EMQX has gained popularity among IoT companies and is used by more than 20,000 global users from over 50 countries, with more than 100 million IoT device connections supported worldwide.

## Build From Source

The `master` branch is for the latest version 5 release, checkout branch `main-v4.3` for version 4.3 and `main-v4.4` for version 4.4.

EMQX requires OTP 22 or 23 for version 4.3, and OTP 24 for 4.4 and 5.0.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emqx/emqx.git
cd emqx
make
_build/emqx/rel/emqx/bin/emqx console
```

For 4.2 or earlier versions, release has to be built from another repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emqx/emqx-rel.git
cd emqx-rel
make
_build/emqx/rel/emqx/bin/emqx console
```

### Building on Apple silicon (M1, M2)

Homebrew on Apple silicon [changed default location of it's home directory](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/9177) from `/usr/local` to `/opt/homebrew` and as a result a few things broke in the process.

Concerning EMQX, when you install `unixodbc` package (one of the dependencies) via Homebrew, and build Erlang/OTP  with [kerl](https://github.com/kerl/kerl), kerl will not be able to find `unixodbc`.

Here is how to solve it:

```bash
brew install unixodbc kerl
sudo ln -s $(realpath $(brew --prefix unixodbc)) /usr/local/odbc
export CC="/usr/bin/gcc -I$(brew --prefix unixodbc)/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix unixodbc)/lib"
kerl build 24.3
mkdir ~/.kerl/installations
kerl install 24.3 ~/.kerl/installations/24.3
. ~/.kerl/installations/24.3/activate
```

Then you can proceed with `make`.
