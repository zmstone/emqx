  rewrite.desc: """The topic rewriting function of EMQX supports rewriting topic A to topic B when the client subscribes to topics, publishes messages, and cancels subscriptions according to user-configured rules.
Each rewrite rule consists of three parts: subject filter, regular expression, and target expression.
Under the premise that the subject rewriting function is enabled, when EMQX receives a subject-based MQTT message such as a `PUBLISH` message,
it will use the subject of the message to sequentially match the subject filter part of the rule in the configuration file. If the match is successful,
the regular expression is used to extract the information in the subject, and then replaced with the target expression to form a new subject.
Variables in the format of `$N` can be used in the target expression to match the elements extracted from the regular expression.
The value of `$N` is the Nth element extracted from the regular expression. For example, `$1` is the regular expression. The first element extracted by the expression.
It should be noted that EMQX uses reverse order to read the rewrite rules in the configuration file.
When a topic can match the topic filter of multiple topic rewrite rules at the same time, EMQX will only use the first rule it matches. Rewrite.
If the regular expression in this rule does not match the subject of the MQTT message, the rewriting will fail, and no other rules will be attempted for rewriting.
Therefore, users need to carefully design MQTT message topics and topic rewriting rules when using them."""
