Disallow enabling `fail_if_no_peer_cert` in listener SSL options if `verify_none` is set.

Setting `fail_if_no_peer_cert = true` and `verify = verify_none` caused connection errors
due to incompatible options.
This fix validates the options when creating or updating a listener to avoid these errors.

Note: any old listener configuration with `fail_if_no_peer_cert = true` and `verify = verify_none`
that was previously allowed will fail to load after applying this fix and must be manually fixed.
